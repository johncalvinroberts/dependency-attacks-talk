# Hello Teammates.

Let's have a quick talk about dependency attacks in Node JS.

<Crumb> 01. What is a dependency attack? </Crumb>

<Steps>

  - Also known as "supply chain attacks"
  - Not just Node JS. Long history.
  - In Node JS, there's also a long history.
    - `left-pad` debacle
    - `event-stream` debacle
    - vulnerabilities frequently found in seemingly innocuous packages
  - Basically, evil packages.
  - Point being - There's clearly a security concern around your `package.json`.

</Steps>

<Crumb> 02. What are some types of dependency attacks in Node JS? </Crumb>

<Steps>

  - Global leakage
  - Prototype pollution/monkey patching
  - Dependency-tree manipulation

</Steps>

## Dependency tree manipulation

Let's focus on this one.

<Crumb> 03. What is dependency tree manipulation? </Crumb>

### The `require` global

Firstly, did you know about `require.resolve`?

```javascript
const isEmail = require('is-email');
console.log(isEmail('john@wiredcraft.com'));
// true
console.log(require.resolve('is-email'));
// '/Users/john/code/johncalvinroberts/dependency-attacks/node_modules/is-email/lib/index.js'
```

Secondly, did you know about `require.cache`? 

---

<Crumb> 03. What is dependency tree manipulation? </Crumb>

```javascript
const isEmail = require('is-email');
console.log(isEmail('john@wiredcraft.com'));
// true
const key = require.resolve('is-email');
const cacheEntry = require.cache[key];
// prints out a cache entry, which is used by other parts of my application
```

```javascript
const isEmail = require('is-email');
// evil override
const myEvilIsEmail = require('./evil-is-email');
const isEmailKey = require.resolve('is-email');
const myEvilIsEmailKey = require.resolve('./evil-is-email');
// globally override the dependency at runtime
require.cache[isEmailKey] = require.cache[myEvilIsEmailKey];
// now we can intercept all emails passed to other dependency
```

The purpose of this contrived demo is:

<Steps>

- Raise awareness of dependency-based attacks in Node JS
- Show how `require.cache` can be a target for injection
- Demonstrate how `require` can be abused
- A real world attack would be much harder to introduce into the ecosystem.

</Steps>

That's it. Thanks for listening.
